AI & ML Learning Sandbox
Overview This repository contains a collection of unorganized scripts and Jupyter notebooks from my self-learning journey and academic coursework. These files represent raw experiments, practice problems, and assignments covering various Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts.

Note This is not a production-ready library. The code structures vary and are primarily for educational documentation.

Contents

Regression: Linear regression implementations (from scratch and using libraries), income prediction, and gradient descent.

Classification: Customer churn prediction, Decision Trees (Breast Cancer, Social Network Ads), and KNN for housing data.

Clustering: Unsupervised learning for customer segmentation.

Computer Vision: Baseline testing vs. data augmentation.

Simulation & Logic: Roulette wheel simulation and Fuzzy Logic fan control.

Miscellaneous: Kaggle road accident analysis and general algorithm tests.
